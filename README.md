This is a simple plugin for the addon [Bagnon](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/bagnon) that shows the item level of your equipable gear, caged battle pet levels and number of container slots. 

If you're looking for something that displays both the purple uncollected eye, item level, BoE status and tones down garbage all at once, we recommend our all-in-one plugin [Bagnon ItemInfo](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/bagnon-iteminfo) to avoid having more button updates than needed.
